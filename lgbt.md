It used to be a meme to teach “tolerance”.  Today, we are striving to realize that “acceptance” is a far better word.  Healthy and happy families accept their members for who they are and strive to see that all members of their family gain happiness in their lives.

Life is not perfect, so not everyone can be perfectly equal, but as long as we try for that, those with less will feel better and be more willing to contribute to society, which benefits everyone.

There are religions out there today, even in our communities of Agawam, Granville and Southwick, that are brutally cruel to LGBT persons.  Finding ways to address bullies from the pulpits is important to the general happiness of our social circles and society.  If you know of churches that are hostile in any way toward LGBT persons, it is your right to peacefully yet earnestly speak up and say something.

Most people wish to be thought of as good people.  Keeping silent does not help.  Churches have changed; the court of public opinion has changed.  Creating happier citizens in Agawam, Granville, and Southwick is a good place to continue this change.  Let’s show surrounding communities that we are friendly, warm, and welcoming places.
