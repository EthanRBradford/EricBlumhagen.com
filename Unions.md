The middle class in the United States during the 50’s and 60’s was the envy of the world.  This was, in large part, due to the successful rise of unions which demanded fair wages, vacation, sick pay, holiday pay, etc.

Today, unions are being attacked by corporations and right wing think tanks.

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/15/rightwing-thinktanks-secret-plot-against-unions">Documents obtained by the Guardian</a> reveal that a network of radical conservative think-tanks, spanning all 50 states, is planning direct marketing campaigns targeted personally at union members to encourage them to quit.
Their internal documents say “Well run opt-out campaigns can cause public-sector unions to experience 5 to 20% declines in membership, costing hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in dues money. This can affect the resources and attention available for union leaders to devote to political action campaigns.”
Public-union workers in Agawam, Granville, and Southwick should take note and elect someone who cares and is aware of this war on unions.

Again, I will join the fight and meet with other representatives in Boston, who are currently brainstorming on ideas whose aim is to minimize the effect of JANUS (a Supreme Court decision which took immediate effect this past June) and SPN (State Policy Network).  I will also regularly meet with local unions to get their input and ideas for thwarting the efforts of union destruction.

Forrest is a proud member of the United Food and Commercial Worker’s Local 1459 chapter.
