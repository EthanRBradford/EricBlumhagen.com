The middle class in the United States during the 50’s and 60’s was the envy of the world.  This was, in large part, due to the successful rise of unions which demanded fair wages, vacation, sick pay, etc.

Today, unions are being attacked by corporations and the elite using propaganda wars.

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/15/rightwing-thinktanks-secret-plot-against-unions">Documents obtained by the Guardian</a> reveal that a network of radical conservative think-tanks, spanning all 50 states, is planning a direct marketing campaign targeted union members personally at to encourage them to quit.
Their internal documents say “Well run opt-out campaigns can cause public-sector unions to experience 5% to 20% declines in membership, costing hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in dues money. This can affect the resources and attention available for union leaders to devote to political action campaigns.”

Public-union workers in Agawam, Granville, and Southwick should take note and elect someone who cares and is aware of this war on unions.

I will join the fight … meeting with other representatives … who are currently working on brainstorming ideas to minimize the effects of JANUS.
