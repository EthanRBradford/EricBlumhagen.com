Our campaign welcomes a wide variety of volunteers.

Please tell all your friends about Forrest and how to reach our web page and <a href="http://{{ page.facebook }}">Facebook page</a>.

To show support to your neighbors, you can <a href="yardsign.html">display a yard sign</a> or <a href="bumpersticker.html">sport a bumper sticker</a>.

We need volunteers to hold signs at the polls and engage interested voters.  We want to cover each polling station in three-hour shifts from when the polls open at 8:00 a.m.  until they close at 8:00 p.m.

Please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email us</a> or call us at <a href="tel:413-324-8891">413-324-8891</a> if you can help out.

We wish to have fun and for our volunteers to have fun.
