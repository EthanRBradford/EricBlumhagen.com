Our campaign welcomes a wide variety of volunteers.

Please tell all your friends about Forrest and how to reach our web page and <a href="http://{{ page.facebook }}">Facebook page</a>.

To show support to your neighbors, you can <a href="yardsign.html">display a yard sign</a> or <a href="bumpersticker.html">sport a bumper sticker</a>.

If you can find time, we are looking for volunteers who can help us for a few hours helping people walk to our rallies, holding signs that help people park, making telephone calls, and much more.

Including a yard sign, esp. if you're on a busy street would be a big help, or display a bumper sticker on your car (they're easily removed).

Please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email us</a> or call us at 413-324-8891 if you can help out.

We wish to have fun and for our volunteers to have fun.
