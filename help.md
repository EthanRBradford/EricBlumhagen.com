Our campaign welcomes a wide variety of volunteers. You can help just by telling all you know about Forrest and <a href="http://{{ page.facebook }}">our Facebook page</a>.

To show support to your neighbors, you can <a href="yardsign.html">display a yard sign</a> or <a href="bumpersticker.html">sport a bumper sticker</a>.

If you can find time, we are looking for volunteers who can help us for a few hours helping people walk to our rallies, holding signs that help people park, making telephone calls, and much more.

Including a yard sign, esp. if you're on a busy street would be a big help, or display a bumper sticker on your car (they're easily removed).

Please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email us</a> if you can help out.
We wish to have fun and our volunteers to have fun.
