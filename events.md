<em>(Rain date: Sunday October 14th)</em>
</div>

<b>Where:</b> Oxford Street in Agawam

<b>Type of Rally:</b> This is a no smoking bring your own chair rally. There is a bit of a walk to get there, but we will have guides to help you. There are no bathroom facilities.
Our aim is to keep this short. Forrest will speak for a short time. Then there will be about a half hour of mingle and greet time. The Rally event will be over in an hour. You may remain and mingle if you wish.

<b>If someone has difficulty walking:</b> Please contact us at 413-324-8891;
special arrangements for parking will be provided for you.

<b>Refreshments:</b> Cider, chili, and cornbread will be served, but we may run out as we do not know how many will be attending.
