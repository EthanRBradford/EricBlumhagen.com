<b>Environment:</b>  We must act now on making changes to stave off the negative effects Global Warming will have on our children and future generations.

<b>Unions:</b>  We must protect unions and do what we can to build public trust in unions.  Unite with those in Boston doing what they can to diminish the latest JANUS decision aimed at destroying unions.

<b>Freedom of the Press:</b>   Designed after the formation of our country whose purpose is to develop a well-informed citizenry.  Having a well-informed Citizenry makes for a strong democracy.

Misinforming the citizenry for political gain or for ill-willed propaganda is wrong and completely unpatriotic

<b>Opioid Epidemic:</b>  Families need answers and support when their loved ones suffer from addiction and have entered into the system.  They should at least know that their loved ones are safe.  Oversight is also needed on those who develop these programs who receive grant monies to ensure they are not misappropriating funds.  These persons should also be contactable.

<b>Spam Phone Calls:</b>  Telephone companies can reduce these calls greatly, yet are currently asking for monthly fees to do so.  Investigation into this is necessary as these calls interrupt all our lives while we are trying to go about our daily chores.  If telephone companies can block these calls, they then should, at no additional cost to their customers.

<b>Corporate Takeover:</b>  The middle class is being taken for a ride by banking fees, insurance prices, pharmaceutical price gouging, hospital costs, etc.  It is time we turn the tables of fairness to the middle class and elect people who care enough to fight for change.
