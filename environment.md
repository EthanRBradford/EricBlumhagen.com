<em>“Never doubt for a moment that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; Indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.” – Margaret Mead</em>

Humanity sits on a railroad track while an ominous freight train is barreling toward us.   If a small child were to accidentally run out into the street, you would run out and save it in order to prevent fatal harm by a passing car.  This action would certainly be noted as a heroic deed.  What are you willing to do to help the future of our children?

“You Can Change The World!   And We Must.”

Forrest has always loved science and is an optimist.  “Science defines the progress of nations today” – he notes.  “If through the tools of science humans are capable of building computers that fit into our personal pockets, then most certainly we can change the course of our climate through action to help our children have a safer place to live decades from now.  This requires caring enough to fight for action.  I am certainly not one of those to sit on those tracks… out of fear… to let that train wreck occur.  I am among one of those who will be a catalyst to work on solutions now, one to offer hope to young ears and eyes watching and listening.”
